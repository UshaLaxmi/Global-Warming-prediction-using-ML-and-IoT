Currently working project:  "Next-Gen Climate Management using IoT and ML for Global Warming Forecasting"
This project aims to predict future trends related to global warming by analyzing environmental data collected from IoT devices. The project combines the power of IoT for real-time data collection with machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions on global warming.

Technologies Used: Machine Learning, IoT, Python, Data Science Libraries (such as Pandas, Scikit-learn), IoT Devices (Sensors).

Using machine learning algorithms, the model is trained on historical data to learn the relationships between environmental factors and the effects of global warming.
Regression algorithms like Linear Regression can be employed to predict future trends. The model is tested and validated to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous data collection through IoT devices ensures that global warming trends are tracked in real time, allowing for timely intervention and mitigation strategies.
Data-Driven Solutions: By leveraging machine learning, this project provides data-driven predictions that can guide efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing future global warming effects.
Environmental Awareness: The project also increases awareness about global warming and its real-time effects on the environment, helping people and organizations understand the importance of sustainability.
